## Protocol/network improvement efforts

## Lightning
#### BTC, LTC, Decred, VTC, ETH (state channels)
*[apparent] Proof that Lightning is mathematically not-decentralized* \

**Notes**:\
- Vitalik responded to this article
- Could be overly antagonistic, but definitely worth reading to think about mechanics of LN probabilistically 
- Lightning network is not necessarily the *only* solution to solving scalability issues (whether on or off-chain)
